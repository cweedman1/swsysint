    <h2>Modern Sourcing, Built on Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Southwest Systems Integrators began as a boots-on-the-ground operation in industrial installation, growing into a full-service integration and sourcing company. We bring a legacy of fabrication, field service, and design — and we use that experience to connect buyers with the right solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're sourcing conveyor hardware, looking to design a new system, or searching for legacy equipment like Richards-Wilcox, Portec, or Logan lines — we know where to find it, and how to make it work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our roots go back generations in industrial handling systems — from Weedman & Associates to Portec and Logan reps before that. SSI brings together new, used, and reconditioned equipment into efficient, reliable systems that work.

    <h2>Industrial Integration with a Legacy</h2>
    <p>Since 2003, Southwest Systems Integrators has delivered practical industrial solutions in material handling, automation, and mechanical contracting. We’ve supported Fortune 500 manufacturers and local operations alike — engineering systems that simply work.</p>

    <p>Born from a lineage of builders, fabricators, and installers, SSI’s roots stretch back through generations of industrial problem-solvers. From field installs and millwright work to system design and equipment sourcing, we've always focused on one thing: making it all work together.</p>

    <p>Today, we continue that tradition by offering tailored solutions, quoting support, and product sourcing across the U.S. — with a legacy of trust and technical precision that speaks for itself.</p>
