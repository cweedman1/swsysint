    <h2>Modern Sourcing, Built on Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Southwest Systems Integrators began as a boots-on-the-ground operation in industrial installation, growing into a full-service integration and sourcing company. We bring a legacy of fabrication, field service, and design — and we use that experience to connect buyers with the right solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're sourcing conveyor hardware, looking to design a new system, or searching for legacy equipment like Richards-Wilcox, Portec, or Logan lines — we know where to find it, and how to make it work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our roots go back generations in industrial handling systems — from Weedman & Associates to Portec and Logan reps before that. SSI brings together new, used, and reconditioned equipment into efficient, reliable systems that work.
